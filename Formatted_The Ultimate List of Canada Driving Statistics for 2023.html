                            of public roads – longer than a round trip to the
                            Moon. Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Alberta
                            accounted for over 75% of the total road length.

                            38,098 lane-kilometres of roadway. 72.8% of the
                            roads are classified as “core” routes, 11.7% are
                            classified as “feeder” routes, and 15.5% are
                            classified as “Northern and remote” routes.

                            registered road motor vehicles. 91.7% of these were
                            light-duty vehicles, a category of vehicles whose

                            vans. 2.6% of registered motor vehicles were

                            Statistics Canada, June 2023) According to the
                            official census figures, from 1996 through 2016, the
                            share of commuters who commuted by car, truck or van
                            declined slightly, from 80.1% in 1996 to 79.5% in
                            2016. The share of commuters who commuted by public
                            transit rose from 10.5% in 1996 to 12.4% in 2016.
                            However, in 2021, the share of commuters who
                            commuted by public transit declined sharply to 7.7%,
                            accompanied by a corresponding rise in commuters by
                            car, truck or van to 84.0%, reversing the prior
                            trends. See the following chart. In the chart,
                            “vehicle” means “car, truck or van”; motorcycles are

                            source. BEVs have no gasoline engine; the batteries
                            are charged by an external power source. EV
                            registrations are up 233.2% from 2017, when there
                            were 215,876 registered EVs. In 2022, 51.8% of

                            fatality rate of drivers by 10%. The risk of being
                            involved in a severe crash is twice as great at 65
                            km/h than it is at 60 km/h. Injuries from a crash at
                            50 km/h are comparable to injuries caused by falling

                            About 73% of those crashes involve a collision with
                            a motor vehicle. Another 25% of those crashes
                            involve a collision with another cyclist or a
                            stationary object. (CAA, 2020) However, because of
                            Canada’s growing population, the fatality rate of
                            cycling decreased from 2.5 deaths per one million
                            population in 2006 to 1.3 deaths per one million
                            population in 2017. (Statistics Canada, July 2019)

                            1.19 million people (a decline of 5% since 2010) and
                            injure 20–50 million more. This works out to over
                            3,200 traffic deaths per day worldwide. However,
                            from 2010 to 2021, 10 countries reduced their annual
                            traffic deaths by more than 50%: Belarus, Brunei

                            In 2019, impaired driving/driving under the
                            influence was a contributing factor in 23.1% of
                            fatal collisions, and speeding/driving too fast for
                            conditions was a contributing factor in 21.5% of
                            fatal collisions. However, in&nbsp;31.0% of fatal
                            collisions that year, no contributing factors were
                            identified. See the following chart.&nbsp;Note that
                            the percentage of accidents involving fatigue is
                            likely an underestimate because of the difficulty of
                            establishing fatigue objectively. (According to a
                            Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police report, as
                            many as 20% of fatal collisions may be caused by
                            drowsy drivers.) Note also that the sum of the
                            values of the identified factors exceeds 100.0%
                            because some collisions involved more than one
                            contributing factor. (Transport Canada, June 2021)

                            fatalities, up 1.3% from 2020. There were 8,185
                            serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes, up
                            4.0% from 2020. There were 4.7 fatalities per
                            100,000 population, the second lowest number of
                            fatalities on record. There were 4.8 fatalities per

                            occur at night or in artificial lighting. 34% of
                            cyclists who were killed in crashes had been struck

                            on city roads (those with a speed limit of up to 70
                            km/h). The remainder occurred on rural roads (with a

                            fatalities were male, and 28.9% were female. The

                            types of vehicles. Males made up 44.4% of fatalities

                            vans but 97.5% of fatalities for truck tractors and
                            95.4% of fatalities for large straight trucks. Note
                            that the percentages for male and female do not
                            always sum to 100% because some fatalities for that
                            type of vehicle might be of other genders or unknown

                            provinces have gone further. Alberta also
                            specifically bans some other potentially distracting
                            activities while driving, such as personal grooming
                            and reading or writing hardcopy materials. In

                            both ears while driving. In Ontario and Quebec, it’s
                            illegal to watch a display screen for a purpose
                            unrelated to driving, such as to watch a video.

                            In 2019, 155 people died in crashes caused by
                            impaired driving. 88 (57%) of these were the
                            drivers, and 67 (43%) were other road users.

                            In 2019, police reported 85,673 incidents of
                            impaired driving, the highest number since 2011. The
                            impaired driving rate (from alcohol or drugs) also
                            increased by 19% from 2018, breaking a downward
                            trend that had begun in 2011. However, the rate of
                            impaired driving causing a fatal accident decreased
                            by 38%, reaching its lowest level since data
                            collection first began. The rate of impaired driving
                            causing injury increased slightly, by 4%.

                            alcohol-impaired driving charges per year declined
                            by 21.7%. However, there was an uptick in
                            alcohol-impaired driving charges in 2019, probably
                            reflecting (at least in part) the imposition of
                            mandatory alcohol screening (MAS) of drivers that
                            year. MAS efforts were cut back during the COVID-19
                            pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, which is one reason
                            that alcohol-impaired driving charges declined
                            again. (Another reason may simply be that fewer
                            drivers were on the roads during the height of the
                            pandemic.) As a result, the number of
                            alcohol-related driving charges in 2021 was 30.3%
                            below the number in 2010. The number of alcohol
                            charges per 100,000 population in 2021 was 38.0%
                            lower than in 2010. See the following two charts.

                            the trip was relatively short (20%), no alternative
                            transportation was available (13%), and the person

                            driving ability, an increase of 15 percentage points
                            from 2017. 79% of those who had used cannabis within
                            the past year also agreed that it can hinder driving
                            ability, an increase of 16 percentage points from

                            ability. 81% of them responded that it slows your
                            reaction time and ability to concentrate, and 67%
                            responded that it makes you a worse driver. However,
                            8% responded that cannabis makes you a more careful
                            driver. And 24% of respondents believed that driving
                            under the influence of cannabis is less dangerous

                            Most traumatic injuries to Canadians aged 15–19 are
                            caused by car crashes. (Desjardins Insurance, 2020)

                            Young Canadians represent 13% of the licensed
                            driving population but account for 20% of motor
                            vehicle deaths and injuries. (Desjardins Insurance,

                            In 2019, 115 persons aged 15–19 were killed in road
                            crashes. 12,010 were injured, of whom 744 were
                            injured seriously enough to require hospitalization.
                            88.8% of these deaths and 86.2% of these injuries
                            occurred to teens as motor vehicle drivers, motor
                            vehicle passengers, or motorcyclists. The rest of
                            the deaths and injuries occurred to them as
                            pedestrians or bicyclists. (Transport Canada, June

                            Until 2020, the rates of fatalities per 100,000
                            population for drivers aged 15–19 and 20–24 had
                            exceeded the rates for all other age groups under
                            age 65. In 2020, those rates dropped sharply,
                            probably because fewer young people were on the road
                            as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            Nevertheless, the fatality rate for drivers aged
                            20–24 still exceeded the rates for all other age
                            groups that year. See the following chart.

                            The most common types of teen driver crashes involve
                            left-hand turns, rear-end events, and running off

                            When a teen driver is carrying a passenger, the risk
                            of a fatal car crash doubles. If two or more

                            Senior drivers often try to reduce their risk of
                            injury by wearing safety belts, observing speed
                            limits, and not drinking and driving. (AAA, 2019)

                            driver-related contributing factors were identified.
                            Identified driver-related factors were
                            distraction/inattention (8% of fatal collisions, 14%
                            of injury collisions); driving too fast for
                            conditions (5% and 9% respectively); fatigue (1.5%
                            of both fatal and injury collisions); and driving
                            under the influence (1.2% and 0.6% respectively).
                            The incidence of fatigue is likely greatly

                            started?) and failed to account for the major

                            found that ridesharing was associated with a 4%
                            reduction in traffic fatalities and a 6.1% reduction
                            in alcohol-related traffic fatalities.

                            Previously in this webpage, we saw that in
                            2020–2021, there was a significant downtick in the
                            percentage of Canadians who commuted by public
                            transit (with a corresponding increase in commuting
                            by car), reversing a prior longer-term increase in
                            the use of public transit.&nbsp; In that same
                            period, the number of vehicle collisions involving
                            death or injury increased, reversing a downtrend
                            since 2015. In addition, the number of commercial
                            vehicle collision fatalities increased sharply in
                            2020–2021 (a sharper increase than in any previous
                            year since 2012), reversing a decade-long general
                            downtrend. There is evidence that some of the
                            effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have been
                            responsible for these events.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            First, a survey of 1,203 persons worldwide conducted
                            in May 2020 found that among these people, there had
                            indeed been a significant shift in transportation
                            preference away from public transit back to private
                            cars – not just in North America but worldwide. (70%
                            of the persons surveyed were from South and
                            South-East Asian countries, 15% were from Oceania
                            and Middle-Eastern countries, and 12% were from
                            European and North American countries.) In the
                            survey, those persons who preferred public transport
                            as their primary means of transportation decreased
                            from 36% before the pandemic to 13% during the
                            pandemic. Conversely, those persons who expressed a
                            preference for travel by car increased from 32%
                            before the pandemic to 39% during the pandemic.
                            (University of Management and Technology, Pakistan,
                            July 2020)
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Second, there is objective evidence of significant
                            increases in risky driving behaviours during the
                            height of the pandemic. From April 2020 to March
                            2021, Canadians drove 13.3% fewer kilometres than
                            the previous 12 months. Despite there being fewer
                            drivers on the roads in 2020, significantly more
                            traffic violations occurred than before. As
                            examples, in New Brunswick, the RCMP issued 16.9%
                            more speeding tickets than in 2019. The Ontario
                            Provincial Police saw a 40.1% increase in the
                            percentage of stunt driving offences over 2019.
                            Edmonton police noted a 200% increase in drivers
                            speeding more than 50 km/h over the speed limit. In
                            Saanich, the number of cars impounded for excessive
                            speeding rose by a remarkable 700%. Toronto Police
                            reported a 35% increase in speeding tickets and an
                            almost 200% increase in stunt driving over 2019.
                            (Traffic Injury Research Foundation, December 2021)
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Third, a survey of 2,099 Canadian drivers performed
                            in both September 2020 and May 2021 found that the
                            self-reported incidence of risky driving behaviours
                            had increased significantly: first in September 2020
                            and then even more so in May 2021. In May 2021, most
                            drivers surveyed stated that they had not changed
                            their driving behaviour during the COVID-19
                            pandemic. However, 7.4% of drivers surveyed admitted
                            that they were now more likely to exceed the speed
                            limit by 20 km/h or more than they had been before
                            the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 23.1% of
                            drivers stated they were now less likely to engage
                            in excessive speeding, indicating that the range of
                            possible behaviours from drivers had widened. 60.2%
                            of the drivers who had said they would be more
                            likely to speed said it was because fewer vehicles
                            were on the road; 17.5% of those drivers cited fewer
                            police patrols as their reason for speeding.

                            Finally, in the May 2021 survey, 7.4% of the drivers
                            surveyed stated that they were more likely to engage
                            in distracted driving than before the pandemic,
                            whereas 22.9% stated that they were less likely to
                            do so. 12.4% of the drivers surveyed admitted that
                            they were having more trouble focusing on the
                            driving task than before the pandemic. 34% of the
                            drivers who had said they would be more likely to
                            drive distracted cited distracting thoughts as their
                            main distraction; only 21.2% cited texting as their
                            main distraction. (Traffic Injury Research

                            surveyed stated that driving had become more
                            dangerous since the COVID-19 pandemic. (Travelers

                            It is forecast that in 2025, about 63% of new cars
                            sold worldwide will have level 2 automation or
                            better. (Level 2 automation employs an automated
                            acceleration and braking system, such as Adaptive
                            Cruise Control, working in conjunction with an
                            automated steering system, such as Lane Keeping
                            Assist. Cars with only Level 1 automation provide
                            either automated acceleration and braking or
                            automated steering at a given time, but not both at
                            the same time.) About 12% of cars sold in 2025 will
                            feature Level 2 Advanced (also known as “Level 2+”)
                            automation. There is no official definition of Level
                            2 Advanced automation, but it is expected to provide
                            more advanced versions of the capabilities of Level
                            2 automation. A vehicle equipped with Level 2
                            Advanced automation may be able to detect
                            pedestrians automatically, for example. About 4% of
                            cars sold in 2025 will be equipped with pilot
                            versions of Level 3 automation. A car equipped with
                            Level 3 automation may be able to change lanes on
                            its own or navigate its way through a complex
                            highway interchange. However, human driver oversight
                            will still be required. By 2030, some cars equipped
                            with Level 4 automation will be available for sale.
                            These cars will be capable of driving entirely on
                            their own, although the driver will still be able to
                            control the vehicle manually if desired. See the
                            following chart. (Counterpoint, November 2022;

                            In&nbsp;April 2021,&nbsp;a survey of automobile
                            owners in Canada found&nbsp;that 32% of respondents
                            were excited about the possibility of owning an
                            autonomous vehicle, but 29% were concerned about it.
                            46% of respondents preferred to remain the driver of
                            the vehicle. 34% of respondents chose Tesla as their
                            most trusted brand in autonomous vehicles. When
                            shopping for an autonomous car in the future, 47% of
                            respondents would choose a Tesla, 31% would choose a
                            BMW, 26% would choose a Honda, and another 26% would
                            choose a Toyota. However, 55% of respondents wanted
                            these brands to be responsible for any accidents.
                            The specific feature most desired by respondents
                            (37%) was autonomous parking. 53% of respondents
                            would like the car to be able to drive them home
                            safety if they were unable to do so (presumably only
                            if they could trust the car to do it safely).
                            Finally, only 14% of respondents were comfortable
                            with the prospect of sharing the road with
                            autonomous delivery trucks or fleets. (CarGurus,
