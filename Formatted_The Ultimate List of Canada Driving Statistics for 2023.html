                            In 2013, 170 Canadians aged 15-19 died in car

                            As of 2008, 350 drivers aged 15-19 were killed each
                            year in road crashes and 24,000 were injured, many
                            seriously. In addition, 350 drivers aged 20-24 were
                            killed each year and 26,000 injured. 80% of these

                            injuries occurred to them as pedestrians or
                            bicyclists. (Traffic Injury Research Foundation,

                            The most common types of teen driver crashes involve
                            left-hand turns, rear-end events, and running off
                            the road. (DriveTeam, 2017)

                            When a teen driver is carrying a passenger, the risk
                            of a fatal car crash doubles. If two or more
                            passengers are present, the odds are five times as

                            Senior drivers often try to reduce their risk of
                            injury by wearing safety belts, observing speed
                            limits, and not drinking and driving. (AAA, 2019)

                            Senior drivers are more likely to hurt themselves

                            crashes at intersections. Typically the older driver
                            turns against oncoming traffic with the right-of-way

                            which means that they expand at anything up to 160

                            One study has found that electronic stability
                            control (ESC) has reduced the risk of being involved
                            in a crash by 7% (95% confidence limits 3-10), the
                            risk of being injured in a crash by 9% (3-14), and
                            the risk of being killed in a crash by 56% (39-68).

                            Studies have shown that forward collision warning
                            (FCW) reduces rear-end crashes by 23%, while FCW
                            with automatic emergency braking (AEB) reduces them
                            by 39%. (IIHS, 2016)

                          <li>
                            Studies have also shown that FCW with AEB reduces
                            the rate of rear-end crashes with injuries by 42%.

                            The biggest drawback of some current FCW systems and
                            AEB systems is too many false alarms. (Consumer
                            Reports, 2019)

                            Vehicle owners have found lane departure warning
                            more annoying than other crash avoidance
                            technologies. (IIHS, 2016)

                            Australia has found that wearing protective clothing
                            significantly reduces the risk of injury to the
                            rider in a motorcycle crash. Motorcyclists were
                            significantly less likely to be admitted to the
                            hospital if they crashed wearing motorcycle jackets
                            (relative risk = 0.79, 95% confidence interval:
                            0.69-0.91), pants (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.94), or
                            gloves (RR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.26-0.66). When garments
                            included fitted body armor, there was a
                            significantly reduced risk of injury to the upper
                            body (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89), hands and
                            wrists (RR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.81), legs (RR =
                            0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.90), feet and ankles (RR =
                            0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.83). Non-motorcycle boots were
                            also associated with a reduced risk of injury
                            compared to shoes or joggers (RR = 0.46, 95% CI:
                            0.28-0.75). (University of Sydney Australia et al.,
                            2011)

                            Europe has found that motorcycle antilock braking
                            systems (ABS) significantly reduce the risk of
                            crashes involving injury to the rider. The
                            effectiveness of motorcycle ABS in reducing injury
                            crashes ranged from 24% (95% confidence interval
                            [CI], 12-36) in Italy to 29% (95% CI, 20-38) in
                            Spain, and 34% (95% CI, 16-52) in Sweden. The
                            reductions in severe and fatal crashes were even
                            greater, at 34% (95% CI, 24-44) in Spain and 42%
                            (95% CI, 23-61) in Sweden. (Swedish Transport
